" Description: This plugin defines a 'Redir' command that takes a register
" and one or more {bar} separated commands. This command will execute 
" these commands and collect their output into the specified register.
" The resulting register could than be inserted anywhere with a :put
" The register must always be specified, and is the first character 
" of the command argument. The remainder of the argument is the command
" to be captured. This command may be separated from the register with 
" a space. Several commands can be specified, but have to be separated
" with a bar:
"
" :Redir {reg} {cmd} [ | {cmd} [ | {cmd} ... ] ]
" 
" Examples:
" 1) Simple case of one command (e.g. :version) to be captured into 
"    register v
"	    :Redir vversion
"	 or
"	    :Redir v version
" 2) Example of two commands (ls and set) to be collected into 
"	 register p
"	    :Redir p ls | set
"	 or
"	    :Redir pls|set
" 3) Example of a command (g/exe) to be appended to register x
"	    :Redir Xg/exe
"	 or
"	    :Redir X g/exe
"
